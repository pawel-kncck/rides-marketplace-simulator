1. There are the following properties in the config file:
    pct_with_app_a_only: 0.20
    pct_with_app_b_only: 0.20
    pct_with_both_apps: 0.60
    Make sure that the app checks if they all add up to a 100%, that the sum is not higher of lower than the 100%

2. Price and time sensitivity are independently generated as random values from a bell curve. This might be a problem - they probably depend on one another. SOme users are more time, others more price sensitive
