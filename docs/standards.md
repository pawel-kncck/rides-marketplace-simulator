Of course. Your focus on documentation from the outset is a sign of a well-planned project. To manage the complexity of this simulator, we need a documentation structure that is modular, serves different audiences, and is easy to keep synchronized with the code.

Based on our entire conversation, here is a recommended structure.

---
### ## Overall Philosophy

The documentation should be split to serve two primary audiences:
1.  **The "User"** (Strategy Managers, Analysts): They need to know **how to use** the simulator and interpret its results.
2.  **The "Developer"** (You, other developers, data scientists): They need to know **how the simulator works** internally to extend, maintain, and calibrate it.

A single, monolithic document would fail both audiences. Therefore, a multi-document approach is best.

### ## Recommended Documentation Structure

I recommend creating four core documents, which could live in a `/docs` directory in your project.

#### **1. Project Overview & Vision (`README.md`)**

This is the main entry point for anyone encountering the project.

* **Purpose:** To quickly explain the "what" and "why" of the simulator.
* **Audience:** Everyone (Users, Developers, Stakeholders).
* **Granularity:** Low (high-level).
* **Contents:**
    * **Problem Statement:** Briefly describe the business challenge (e.g., the "Market Share Elasticity Conundrum").
    * **Vision:** What this simulator aims to achieve (a high-fidelity digital twin for strategic decision-making).
    * **Core Capabilities:** A bulleted list of the key questions the model can answer (e.g., ROI of incentives, impact of driver exclusivity).
    * **Quick Start:** Basic instructions for setup, running the tests, and executing a pre-configured simulation run.
    * **Table of Contents:** Links to the other, more detailed documents.

---
#### **2. User Guide & Scenario Cookbook**

This document is focused entirely on the practical application of the simulator.

* **Purpose:** To empower non-technical users to run their own experiments and scenarios.
* **Audience:** The "User" (Strategy, Business Analysis).
* **Granularity:** Medium.
* **Contents:**
    * **Configuration Reference:** A detailed, business-friendly explanation of every parameter in the `.yaml` configuration files.
    * **Running a Simulation:** A step-by-step guide on how to launch a run from the command line.
    * **Interpreting Outputs:** A guide on what the output metrics mean and how to analyze the resulting CSV/JSON files.
    * **Scenario Cookbook:** A collection of practical, step-by-step tutorials for common strategic questions, such as:
        * "How to model a 3-month price war."
        * "How to A/B test a new driver bonus and calculate its ROI."
        * "How to simulate the impact of increasing driver exclusivity."

---
#### **3. System Architecture & Developer Guide**

This is the technical deep-dive for the builders.

* **Purpose:** To explain the internal workings of the code so it can be maintained and extended.
* **Audience:** The "Developer" (You).
* **Granularity:** High (technical).
* **Contents:**
    * **Architecture Overview:** A diagram and explanation of the file/folder structure and how the core modules (`engine`, `market`, `agents`, `platform`) interact.
    * **Deep Dives:** Detailed sections for each major component:
        * **Agent Logic:** Full explanation of the state machines, utility functions, and decision-making logic for both riders and drivers.
        * **The Matcher:** A step-by-step description of the matching algorithm and the `Order Try` flow.
        * **The `Test` Framework:** How to create and run new A/B tests for incentives.
    * **Development Process:** Guidelines for contributing, including how to write and run unit/E2E tests and how to use the logging framework for debugging.

#### **4. Feature & Parameter Reference (The "Living Document")**

This is the key to keeping the documentation up-to-date. It's a central, structured registry of every feature and its corresponding code and configuration. This is much easier to update than prose.

* **Purpose:** To provide a single source of truth for all simulation features and their status.
* **Audience:** Everyone.
* **Granularity:** High (but structured and scannable).
* **Format:** A structured table in a Markdown file, a wiki page, or a tool like Notion.

**Example Entry:**

| Feature Name | Description | Status | YAML Parameter | Code Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Driver Patience** | Models how long a multi-homing driver waits on their preferred app before checking the competitor. | `[IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ]` | `driver.patience_threshold_ticks` | `simulator/agents/driver/logic.py` |
| **Rider App Download**| A low-probability event for a rider to download a competitor's app after a very poor experience. | `[IN DEVELOPMENT üöß]` | `rider.download_trigger_threshold` | `simulator/agents/rider/logic.py` |
| **Surge Pricing** | A dynamic pricing model based on the real-time supply/demand ratio in a hex cell. | `[PLANNED üìù]`| `platform.surge_multiplier_max`| `simulator/platform/matcher.py` |

This structure ensures that anyone can quickly see what the simulator does, what's being worked on, and where to find the relevant code or configuration, making it far more maintainable in the long run.
